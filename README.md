# Wordle Game
Wordle is a popular word-guessing game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the game provides feedback by highlighting letters: green for correct letters in the correct position, yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, and gray for incorrect letters.

I designed and developed my own version of this game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express, incorporating asynchronous API calls to fetch and validate word lists dynamically. This implementation mimics the real-time feedback and interactive features of Wordle, creating an engaging and user-friendly experience for players.
